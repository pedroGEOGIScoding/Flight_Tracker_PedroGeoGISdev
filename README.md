| --- | --- | --- |
| Map Container | `.leaflet-container` | Main map viewport |
| Panes | `.leaflet-pane`, `.leaflet-tile-pane` | Layer organization |
| Controls | `.leaflet-control`, `.leaflet-bar` | Zoom and layer controls |
| Popups | `.leaflet-popup`, `.leaflet-popup-content` | Information overlays |
| Tooltips | `.leaflet-tooltip` | Hover information |

### Map Control Styling

The map controls use a cohesive visual design with rounded corners, shadows, and hover states:

```
Visual PropertiesMap Controls.leaflet-bar.leaflet-control-zoom-in.leaflet-control-zoom-out.leaflet-control-layersbox-shadow: 0 1px 5pxborder-radius: 4pxhover statesfocus states
```

**Sources: [dist/assets/index-6bPaNv2g.css 1](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/dist/assets/index-6bPaNv2g.css#L1-L1)**

## Custom Component Styling

Beyond the Leaflet integration, the application includes custom CSS modules for specific UI components, identifiable by CSS class names with hash suffixes for style encapsulation.

### Map Container Module

The map container uses CSS modules with scoped styling:

| Class | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `_mapContainer_1746v_1` | Fixed positioning for full-screen map |
| `_map_1746v_1` | Map dimensions (100% width/height) |
| `_overlay_1746v_16` | Centered overlay for UI elements |
| `_error_1746v_28` | Error message styling |

### Layout Structure

```
PositioningMap Layout._mapContainer_1746v_1._map_1746v_1._overlay_1746v_16position: fixedposition: absolutetransform: translate(-50%, -50%)
```

### Responsive Design

The map container implements responsive design with viewport-relative units:

- **Height Calculation**: `height: calc(100vh - 56px)` accounting for header space
- **Full Viewport**: `top: 56px, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0`
- **Overlay Centering**: Absolute positioning with transform-based centering

### Content Hashing Strategy

```
Distribution OutputVite Build ProcessSource FilesHomeImage.jpgplane.pngvite.svgContent HashingAsset OptimizationAsset CopyingHomeImage-gPZdBfKJ.jpgplane-B2eNSDIj.pngvite.svg
```

The content hashing follows the pattern `[name]-[hash].[ext]` where:

- `gPZdBfKJ` is the content hash for the homepage image
- `B2eNSDIj` is the content hash for the plane icon
- SVG files may not always receive hashes depending on import method

## Cache Management Strategy

The content hashing system ensures that assets can be cached indefinitely by browsers while still allowing for immediate updates when content changes:

| Hash Pattern | Cache Behavior | Update Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename-[hash].ext` | Long-term caching | Hash changes on content modification |
| `filename.ext` | Short-term caching | Manual cache invalidation required |

This approach allows the application to benefit from aggressive browser caching while ensuring users always receive the latest version of modified assets.

## External API Integration

Relevant source files

- [.env](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/.env)

## Purpose and Scope

This document covers the integration of external APIs and services within the Flight Management Tool. The application relies on two primary external services: the WebAppAPI service for flight data operations and Leaflet-based map tile services for geographical visualization. This page details the authentication mechanisms, configuration management, and API client architecture used to interface with these external systems.

For information about the frontend application components that consume these APIs, see [Frontend Application](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/2-frontend-application). For build system configuration that supports API integration, see [Build System and Development](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/4-build-system-and-development).

## WebAppAPI Service Integration

The Flight Management Tool integrates with an external WebAppAPI service to handle flight data operations. This integration uses a combination of UUID-based identification and secret key authentication.

### Authentication Configuration

The WebAppAPI authentication is configured through environment variables stored in the application's configuration file. The authentication mechanism uses a compound credential format containing both a UUID identifier and a secret key.

```
.env Configuration FileWebAppAPI Credential StringUUID Component
9e89fdda-0a66-43ec-a267-893bce5b4118Secret Key Component
kc5bPrvWHzFJpYfTCorpH2aTdpg1I2aygBSzR63Sc09b5ca9API Client LayerExternal WebAppAPI Service
```

**WebAppAPI Authentication Flow**

The credential string follows a pipe-delimited format where the UUID serves as the client identifier and the secret key provides authentication security. The API client extracts these components during initialization to establish authenticated connections with the WebAppAPI service.

**Sources:**[.env 1](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/.env#L1-L1)

### API Client Architecture

The application implements a dedicated API client layer that manages communication with external services. This layer handles credential management, request authentication, and response processing for flight data operations.

```
Frontend UI ComponentsApplication State ManagerAPI Client LayerCredential ManagementRequest HandlerResponse ProcessorWebAppAPI Service Endpoints
```

**API Client Component Responsibilities**

The API client layer provides a structured interface between the frontend application and external services. It abstracts authentication details, manages request lifecycle, and ensures consistent data flow throughout the application.

**Sources:**[.env 1](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/.env#L1-L1)

## Map Services Integration

The application integrates with Leaflet-based map tile services to provide interactive geographical visualization capabilities. This integration supports the display of flight paths, aircraft positions, and geographical context for flight management operations.

### Leaflet Map Service Architecture

The map services integration leverages the Leaflet mapping library to connect with external map tile providers. This architecture enables real-time map rendering and interactive geographical features within the flight management interface.

```
Leaflet Map ComponentMap Tile LayerInteractive Map ControlsExternal Map Tile ProvidersFlight Data OverlayMap User Interface
```

**Map Service Integration Points**

The Leaflet integration provides multiple service connection points for different map functionalities. Tile providers supply base map imagery, while overlay services handle flight-specific geographical data presentation.

**Sources:**[.env 1](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/.env#L1-L1)

## Configuration Management

External API integration relies on centralized configuration management through environment variables. This approach provides secure credential storage and flexible service endpoint configuration across different deployment environments.

### Environment Variable Structure

The configuration system uses a single environment file to manage all external service credentials and endpoints. This centralized approach simplifies deployment and maintains security best practices for sensitive authentication data.

| Configuration Key | Purpose | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WebAppAPI` | WebAppAPI service authentication | `UUID\\|SecretKey` |

The application loads external API configuration during startup, parsing compound credential strings and initializing service connections. This process ensures that all external integrations are properly authenticated before the application becomes available to users.

```
"WebAppAPI Service""API Client Initializer""Configuration Parser""Environment Loader""Application Startup""WebAppAPI Service""API Client Initializer""Configuration Parser""Environment Loader""Application Startup""Load .env configuration""Parse WebAppAPI credential string""Extract UUID and secret components""Initialize with parsed credentials""Establish authenticated connection""Confirm authentication status""Report service readiness"
```

**Configuration Security Considerations**

The environment-based configuration approach isolates sensitive credentials from source code while providing runtime access to necessary authentication data. This separation supports secure deployment practices and credential rotation without code changes.

**Sources:**[.env 1](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/.env#L1-L1)

## Data Flow Integration

External API integration follows a structured data flow pattern that maintains separation between different service types while providing unified access through the application's state management system.

### Service Integration Data Flow

The data flow architecture ensures that flight data from WebAppAPI and geographical data from map services are properly coordinated within the application's state management system.

```
User Interface LayerState ManagementAPI Client LayerWebAppAPI ServiceMap Tile ServicesData Processing Layer
```

**Integration Coordination**

The external API integration coordinates multiple service types through a unified client layer that manages authentication, request routing, and response processing for all external dependencies.

## Asset Optimization and Naming

Vite implements content-based hashing for cache busting and optimal browser caching strategies.

### Hashing Strategy

| Asset Type | Naming Pattern | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript | `index-[hash].js` | `index-KO6l-vZL.js` | Cache invalidation |
| CSS | `index-[hash].css` | `index-6bPaNv2g.css` | Style versioning |
| Images | `[name]-[hash].[ext]` | `plane-B2eNSDIj.png` | Asset fingerprinting |

The hash values are generated based on file content, ensuring:

- Automatic cache invalidation when files change
- Long-term caching for unchanged assets
- Unique identifiers for each build version

## ESLint Configuration

Relevant source files

- [eslint.config.js](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js)

This document details the ESLint configuration setup for enforcing JavaScript and JSX code quality standards throughout the Flight Management Tool project. The configuration implements React-specific linting rules and integrates with the Vite development workflow to maintain consistent code quality.

For information about the broader development environment setup, see [Development Environment Setup](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/4.1-development-environment-setup). For editor-specific configurations that complement ESLint, see [Editor Configuration](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/5.2-editor-configuration).

## Configuration Overview

The ESLint configuration uses the modern flat config format and is specifically tailored for React development with JSX support. The configuration file establishes linting rules for JavaScript and JSX files while excluding build artifacts from analysis.

### ESLint Configuration Structure

```
eslint.config.jsignores: ['dist']files: ['**/*.{js,jsx}']languageOptionspluginsrulesecmaVersion: 2020globals.browserparserOptionsecmaVersion: 'latest'ecmaFeatures: { jsx: true }sourceType: 'module'react-hooksreact-refreshno-unused-vars custom configreact-refresh/only-export-components
```

Sources: [eslint.config.js 1-33](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L1-L33)

## Language Configuration

The ESLint setup defines specific language options to support modern JavaScript and React development patterns.

| Configuration | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ecmaVersion` | 2020 | Sets baseline ECMAScript version |
| `globals` | `globals.browser` | Provides browser environment globals |
| `parserOptions.ecmaVersion` | 'latest' | Enables latest ECMAScript features |
| `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.jsx` | true | Enables JSX syntax parsing |
| `parserOptions.sourceType` | 'module' | Treats files as ES modules |

The configuration targets browser environments and enables JSX parsing for React components, as defined in [eslint.config.js 10-18](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L10-L18)

Sources: [eslint.config.js 10-18](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L10-L18)

## Plugin Integration

The configuration incorporates two React-specific ESLint plugins to enforce best practices for React development.

### React Hooks Plugin

The `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin enforces the Rules of Hooks and provides warnings for potential issues with React Hook usage. This plugin is configured at [eslint.config.js 20-21](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L20-L21) and applies the recommended rules from [eslint.config.js 25](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L25-L25)

### React Refresh Plugin

The `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` plugin ensures components are compatible with Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) system. The plugin configuration includes the `react-refresh/only-export-components` rule with a warning level and allows constant exports, as specified in [eslint.config.js 27-30](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L27-L30)

Sources: [eslint.config.js 19-22](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L19-L22) [eslint.config.js 25](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L25-L25) [eslint.config.js 27-30](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L27-L30)

## Rule Configuration

### ESLint Rules Hierarchy

```

```

Sources: [eslint.config.js 23-31](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L23-L31)

### Custom Rule Definitions

The configuration extends the recommended rule sets with project-specific customizations:

**Variable Usage Rule**: The `no-unused-vars` rule includes a custom pattern `^[A-Z_]` that ignores unused variables starting with uppercase letters or underscores, as defined in [eslint.config.js 26](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L26-L26) This pattern accommodates constants and utility variables that may be imported but not immediately used.

**Component Export Rule**: The `react-refresh/only-export-components` rule is set to warning level with `allowConstantExport: true`, enabling the export of both React components and constant values from the same module while maintaining HMR compatibility, as configured in [eslint.config.js 27-30](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L27-L30)

Sources: [eslint.config.js 26](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L26-L26) [eslint.config.js 27-30](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L27-L30)

## File Processing Configuration

### Target Files and Exclusions

```
**/*.{js,jsx}ESLint Processingdist/Excluded from LintingJavaScript FilesReact Component FilesApply All RulesReact-specific Rules
```

Sources: [eslint.config.js 7](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L7-L7) [eslint.config.js 9](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L9-L9)

The configuration applies to all JavaScript and JSX files using the pattern `**/*.{js,jsx}` while explicitly ignoring the `dist` directory to exclude build artifacts from analysis. This ensures that only source code files are subject to linting rules, while generated production assets remain untouched.

The ignore pattern for the `dist` directory prevents ESLint from processing the optimized and minified files created by the Vite build process, focusing analysis efforts on maintainable source code.

Sources: [eslint.config.js 7](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L7-L7) [eslint.config.js 9](https://github.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/blob/2ea0e8a5/eslint.config.js#L9-L9)

This document covers the automated deployment pipeline and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for the Flight Management Tool. The CI/CD system uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the master branch.

For information about the build system and development tools, see [Build System and Development](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/4-build-system-and-development). For details about production build artifacts, see [Production Build Artifacts](https://deepwiki.com/pedroGEOGIScoding/Flight_Tracker_PedroGeoGISdev/4.2-production-build-artifacts).

## Purpose and Scope

The deployment system handles the complete automation of building the React application and deploying it to GitHub Pages. The pipeline is triggered automatically on code changes and manages the entire process from source code to live deployment without manual intervention.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The deployment pipeline follows a linear workflow that transforms source code into a live web application through automated build and deployment steps.
